# TO RUN:
"npm test" to see the test results (ctrl+c to break).

# EXERCISES:

Open up `say-goodbye.spec.ts` -

1. Break the test into `Given` `When` and `Then` functions. 

2. Wrap them with a `describe()` describing the input value

3. Write a second test for a *no input* use case.
   Also with "Given When Then" functions.
   it should be also wrapped with it's own `describe()`.
    
4. Extract the `When` function from the two test cases to the parent `describe`.
