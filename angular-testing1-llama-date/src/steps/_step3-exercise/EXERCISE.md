# TO RUN:
"ng test" to see the test results (ctrl+c to break).

# GET YOUR FEET WET:

Open up `say-goodbye.spec.ts` -

1. Write a test that checks the `sayGoodbye` function 
   with the input `"Bonnie"`. 

2. Write another test that checks for no input

3. Group the two tests with a `describe` function

4. Wrap the second test inside of another nested `describe`.

5. Write a beforeEach function with a `console.log('I LOVE MY LLAMAS!')`
   
   Place it in different locations to see what happens.

   Read the console, and feel weird about it...
